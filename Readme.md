# Credits

I want to thank the following people and organizations:

* **Tobias Hochgürtel.** It was Toibias's [C4 plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Process_Methodology) which has inspired me to explore this plugin. I used the C4 plugin as the code-base for this plugin:
* [**Dov Dori**](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/en/people/userprofile/dori.html) for OPM itself
* [Draw.io](https://draw.io) for providing draw.io as open source software..
